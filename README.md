I used the Flask framework for my solution because i am most comfortable with Python

Folder Structure
app.py: The main Flask application file containing the routes and functions to handle file uploads and data processing.
uploads/: The folder where uploaded Excel files are saved.
templates/: Contains the HTML templates for rendering the web pages.


The application relies on the following Python packages:
Flask
pandas
matplotlib
base64
